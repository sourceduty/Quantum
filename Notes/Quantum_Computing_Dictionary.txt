Entanglement: A quantum phenomenon where particles become interconnected such that the state of one particle instantly influences the state of another, no matter the distance separating them.

Quantum State: The state of a quantum system, described by a wavefunction, that encapsulates all information about the system's properties.

Quantum Measurement: The process by which a quantum system's state becomes definite upon measurement, causing a collapse from a superposition of states to one particular state.
